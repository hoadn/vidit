#Vidit ReadME

Vidit is an open source android app to download and play videos uploaded by you and your friends, the videos in which you were tagged in a long time, relive the memories. Search the videos from title and owner just like you do in youtube, download them in your device and play them anytime anywhere. :)

This is the alpha version, and supports limited functionality like videos by friends and videos by you. Still have to add search functionality and tagged videos functionality.
